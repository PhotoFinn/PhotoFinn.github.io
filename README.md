# Terminology
- *HTML*: The "structure" of a page. Think "here's a heading which says 'blah', here's a paragraph that says 'something else', and there's a navbar which has the following links: 'yada, yada, yada'"
- *CSS*: The "style" of a page. Think "links are red, we use this font, put the nav bar on the upper right hand corner"
